/*
 *  Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allow some objects
 *  to notify other objects about changes in their state.
*/

/*
    The observer pattern proves a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to
    and from these events for any object that implements
    a subscriber interface
 */
//Complexity Medium>Hard **/***
//Popularity: High ***/***
/*
Usabe Examples: The Observer pattern is pretty common in TypeScript code,
especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to events
happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.

IDENTIFICATION: the pattern can be recognizes by subscription methods,
that store in a list and by calls to the update method issued to objects
in that list.
*/


//CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE
/* This example illustrates the structure of the OBSERVER
    design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

    * WHAT CLASSES DOES IT consist of ?
    * WHAT ROLES DO THESES CLASSES PLAY ?
    * in WHAT WAY the elements of the pattern are related ?
